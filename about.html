          <h2>Our history</h2>
          <p>
            It all began in a beautiful forest in Norway, where 18-year old Jo
            Molver hiked with his grandfather. The rain was pouring, they were
            drenched through despite wearing rainwear, and Jo complained to his
            grandfather that every rain jacket he had ever owned did not keep
            its promise of keeping him dry, and his grandfather said;
            <strong>“Then why don’t you make a better one?”</strong>, and so
            following his idol’s suggestion, that is what Jo set out to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the following years, Jo and his growing team focused all their
            energy into making affordable, sustainable and comfortable clothing
            for active people, and now Rainydays has
            <strong>sold more than 160 000 rain jackets</strong> to happy,
            tenacious adventurers.

          <h2>Our mission and vision</h2>
          <p>
            Being active and exploring what the nature has to offer is core to
            our happiness and health, and so clothes and high prices shouldn’t
            stop us from doing what we love.
            <strong
              >>We make our clothes durable with high quality for an affordable
              price</strong
            >, so that as many people as possible can enjoy the fresh air no
            matter the weather.
          </p>
          <p>
            We and our customers want to spend as much time outside as possible,
            and so it is important for us to preserve our nature as best we can,
            limiting the ecological impact. Therefore, we make
            <strong
              >clothes that last long, using organic cotton and recyclable
              materials</strong
            >, and donate 1% of our income to environmental groups.
