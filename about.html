          <h2>Our history</h2>
          <p>
            It all began in a beautiful forest in Norway, where 18-year old Jo Molver hiked with his grandfather. The rain was pouring, they were drenched
            through despite wearing rainwear, and Jo complained to his grandfather that every rain jacket he had ever owned did not keep its promise of keeping
            him dry, and his grandfather said;
            <strong>“Then why don’t you make a better one?”</strong>, and so following his idol’s suggestion, that is what Jo set out to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the following years, Jo and his growing team focused all their energy into making affordable, sustainable and comfortable clothing for active
            people, and now Rainydays has
            <strong>sold more than 160 000 rain jackets</strong> to happy, tenacious adventurers.

          <h2>Our mission and vision</h2>
          <p>
            Being active and exploring what the nature has to offer is core to our happiness and health, and so clothes and high prices shouldn’t stop us from
            doing what we love.
           <blockquote>"We make our clothes durable with high quality for an affordable price, so that as many people as possible can enjoy the fresh air
            no matter the weather."" - Jo Molver</blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            We and our customers want to spend as much time outside as possible, and so it is important for us to preserve our nature as best we can, limiting
            the ecological impact. Therefore, we make
            <strong>clothes that last long, using organic cotton and recyclable materials</strong>, and donate 1% of our income to environmental groups.
          </p>
