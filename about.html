    <section class="history">
    <h2>Our history</h2>
    <p>It all began in a beautiful forest in 
        Norway, where 18-year old Jo Molver 
        hiked with his grandfather. The rain 
        was pouring, they were drenched 
        through despite wearing rainwear, and 
        Jo complained to his grandfather that 
        every rain jacket he had ever owned 
        did not keep its promise of keeping 
        him dry, and his grandfather said; 
        <strong>“Then why don’t you make a 
        better one?”</strong>, and so following his idol’s suggestion, 
        that is what Jo set out to do.
    </p>
    <p> In the following years, Jo and his 
        growing team focused all their energy 
        into making affordable, sustainable and 
        comfortable clothing for active people, 
        and now Rainydays has <strong>sold more 
        than 160 000 rain jackets</strong> to happy,
        tenacious adventurers.

        <h2>Our mission and vision</h2>
        <p>Being active and exploring what the 
            nature has to offer is core to our 
            happiness and health, and so clothes 
            and high prices shouldn’t stop us from 
            doing what we love. We make our 
            clothes durable with high quality 
            for an affordable price, so that as 
            many people as possible can enjoy the 
            fresh air no matter the weather.
        </p>
        <p>
            We and our customers want to spend 
            as much time outside as possible, and 
            so it is important for us to preserve our 
            nature as best we can, limiting the 
            ecological impact. Therefore, we 
            make clothes that last long, using 
            organic cotton and recyclable 
            materials, and donate 1% of our 
            income to environmental groups.  
        </p>
